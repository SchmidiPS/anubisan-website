            <h2>Name and Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                The name Anubisan is derived from <strong>Anubis</strong>, the ancient Egyptian god of healing, and <strong>San</strong>, which originates 
                from the Latin word "sanare" (to heal). <strong>Anubis</strong> symbolizes protection, restoration, and renewal, while <strong>San</strong> highlights 
                our scientific and healing approach. This combination of words merges tradition and modernity, reflecting our philosophy of healing with respect 
                for the past and innovative technologies of the present. Anubisan represents our mission not just to close wounds but to restore quality of life 
                and bring hope to patients.
